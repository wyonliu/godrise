## 英文版 Prompt

**Scene**: A 12-year-old girl walks barefoot from the tip of an ancient pine tree into empty sky above an infinite sea of clouds, awakening to the art of treading the void.

**Duration**: 15 seconds

**Animation Style**: Traditional Chinese ink wash animation (水墨动画), referencing the visual language of *Fog Hill of Five Elements* (雾山五行) and the color palette of *A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains* (千里江山图). Brushstroke textures visible in every surface. Lines bleed at edges like wet ink on rice paper.

### Shot Breakdown (15 seconds)

**[0s–3s] Extreme close-up: bare feet on pine bark**
- Camera starts on the girl's bare feet gripping the narrowing tip of a horizontal pine branch. Pine bark texture rendered in rough dry-brush strokes (枯笔). Each toe curls against the last ridge of bark. Below the toes: nothing — only swirling white cloud sea catching jade-green starlight.
- Sound: Deep, slow heartbeat (松心, the pine's heartbeat, one beat every 3 seconds). Wind. A single guqin note, sustained, trembling.

**[3s–6s] Low-angle wide shot: the step into void**
- Camera pulls back and drops below the pine tip, shooting upward. The girl is silhouetted against a sky of broken jade-colored stars. The pine branch ends. She lifts her left foot. Holds it suspended for one breath. Then places it forward — onto nothing.
- The moment her foot touches empty air: a ripple spreads outward from the point of contact, like a stone dropped into still water — but the water is invisible. The ripple catches starlight and glows faintly jade-green. The cloud sea far below mirrors the ripple.
- Her hair lifts. Her grey shirt flutters. Ink-wash wind lines stream from her figure.
- Sound: The guqin note resolves into a slow ascending phrase. A bamboo flute (笛) enters, playing a melody that sounds ancient and impossibly sad and triumphant at the same time.

**[6s–10s] Tracking shot: walking on air**
- Camera orbits slowly (180° over 4 seconds) as she takes three more steps. Each step sends another invisible ripple. She walks with increasing confidence — the first step was hesitant, the fourth is steady, the fifth is almost dancing.
- Behind her, the ancient pine's crown glows brighter with each step she takes — jade light pulses through its needles, and the pine seems to lean forward, reaching after her, its branches extended like an elder's outstretched arms.
- Below: the cloud sea parts slightly beneath her path, revealing for one flash-frame the impossible depth below — thousands of meters of mountain cliff face vanishing into darkness. Then the clouds close again.
- Her bare feet leave fading light-prints on the air — footprints that dissolve like ink in water after two seconds.
- Sound: Flute melody builds. A pipa (琵琶) joins with tremolo plucking. The pine's heartbeat synchronizes with hers — both beating together now.

**[10s–13s] Wide establishing shot: girl standing in sky**
- Camera pulls to extreme wide. The full scope is revealed: a tiny human figure standing in the middle of absolute emptiness — cloud sea below stretching to every horizon, jade stars above, and one ancient pine on a cliff face behind her, glowing like a green lantern. She stands perfectly still. Wind moves through her. She is the only solid thing between heaven and earth.
- Around her feet, the accumulated ripples from her steps form a pattern — concentric circles that, seen from above, resemble the rings of a tree trunk. Her footprints are the tree's growth rings. She has become a tree standing in sky.
- Sound: All instruments pause. One second of pure wind. Then a single, clear, high note — not from any instrument — the girl hums one note. The note makes the cloud sea shiver.

**[13s–15s] Close-up: her face, turning back**
- She turns her head and looks back toward the pine. Smile. Not a big smile. The smallest possible smile — the kind that happens when you realize you can do something you were afraid of. Starlight catches the moisture in her eyes — not tears, just the natural brightness of someone who has just understood something enormous.
- Behind her, barely visible in the last frame: the silhouette of a boy standing on the pine's trunk, watching her. He is translucent. Fading. But he is smiling too.
- Fade to black.
- Sound: The hum fades. The pine's heartbeat — one final, deep pulse. Silence.

### Technical Notes
- **Color palette**: Dominated by ink black, cloud white, and jade green (翠). Occasional warm gold from starlight reflections. No bright or saturated colors — this is a night scene painted in ink wash with jade-light accents.
- **Texture**: Every surface should show visible brushstroke texture. The clouds are painted with wet ink technique (泼墨). The pine bark is dry brush (枯笔). The girl's clothes are fine-line brushwork (工笔). The stars are splattered ink dots (点苔).
- **Motion style**: All movement is fluid and slightly slower than real-time (0.8x speed feeling). No sudden cuts. Camera movement is continuous and organic, like a bird circling. The girl's walking should feel weightless but grounded — not floating, but choosing where to place weight on invisible ground.
- **Key visual metaphor**: A human being walking on nothing, supported only by will — the quintessential image of Chinese martial arts fantasy (武侠), rendered in the medium of Chinese painting (国画).

### 分镜（15秒）

**【0-3秒】极近特写：赤脚踩在松皮上**
- 镜头起于少女赤脚紧握松枝末梢。松皮以枯笔笔法渲染，苍劲粗粝。脚趾扣住最后一道树皮纹路。脚趾前方——空无一物——唯有翻涌的白色云海，映着碧玉般的星光。
- 音效：深沉缓慢的心跳（松的心跳，每三秒一次）。风声。一声古琴长音，颤而不断。

**【3-6秒】仰拍大全景：踏入虚空的一步**
- 镜头拉远并降至松枝下方仰拍。少女逆光剪影映在碎玉色的星空中。松枝到了尽头。她抬起左脚。悬停一个呼吸。然后——向前落下——踩在空气上。
- 脚触及虚空的瞬间：以落点为圆心向四周扩散出一圈涟漪，如石子投入静水——但水是看不见的。涟漪捕捉星光，泛出淡淡的翠绿微光。万丈之下的云海表面映出同样的涟漪。
- 发丝飞扬。灰色短衫翻飞。水墨风线从她身上流淌而出。
- 音效：古琴长音解入一段缓慢上行的旋律。竹笛加入，吹一支又古老又悲壮又昂扬的曲调。

**【6-10秒】环绕跟拍：在空中行走**
- 镜头以4秒完成180°环绕。她又迈出三步。每一步都荡开无形的涟漪。从第一步的犹豫，到第四步的从容，到第五步——几乎是在舞蹈。
- 身后迎客松的树冠随她每一步愈加明亮——翠光在松针间脉动，松仿佛在朝她倾斜、伸展，枝干张开如长辈张开的双臂。
- 脚下：云海在她行走路径下方微微裂开，闪帧般露出下方的万丈绝壁，然后云层又合拢。
- 赤脚在空气上留下渐淡的光痕足迹——如墨入水，两秒后消散。
- 音效：笛声渐强。琵琶以轮指加入。松的心跳与她的心跳同步——天人合一。

**【10-13秒】超大全景：立于天地之间**
- 镜头拉至极远。全貌呈现：一个渺小的人形站在绝对的虚空正中——云海在下铺展至天际尽头，碧星在上，身后崖壁上一棵古松如翠色灯盏。她一动不动地站着。风穿过她。她是天地之间唯一的实体。
- 她脚下累积的涟漪从高处俯瞰——形成同心圆的图案，宛如一截树干的年轮。她的足迹就是树的年轮。她已成为一棵立于天空的树。
- 音效：所有乐器骤停。一秒纯风声。然后一个清澈、高亢的声音——不是乐器——少女轻哼一声。这一声让整片云海为之一颤。

**【13-15秒】近景：回眸**
- 她转头回望松。微笑。极小极小的微笑——那种刚刚发现自己能做到一件害怕的事时才会有的微笑。星光映出眼中的水光——不是泪，是刚刚理解了某件巨大事物的人眼中自然的亮光。
- 身后，最后一帧中隐约可见：一个少年的剪影站在松干上，望着她。半透明。正在消散。但他也在微笑。
- 渐黑。
- 音效：哼声渐隐。松的心跳——最后一声深沉的脉搏。寂静。

### 技术要点
- **色彩**：以墨黑、云白、翠绿为主色调，辅以星光暖金。无饱和色——夜景水墨，翠光为引。
- **质感**：所有表面须可见毛笔笔触。云用泼墨法，松皮用枯笔法，少女衣裳用工笔法，星辰用点苔法。
- **运动风格**：所有动态流畅且略慢于实时（约0.8倍速感）。无硬切。镜头运动连续有机，如飞鸟盘旋。少女行走须有"无重但有根"之感——非飘浮，而是选择在何处落下意志。
- **核心视觉隐喻**：一个人踏虚而行，唯凭心意——武侠的终极意象，以国画的语言呈现。
