**Style**: Chinese ink-wash animation (水墨动画) meets modern anime. Reference: "Fog Hill of Five Elements" (雾山五行) visual style crossed with the color palette of the ancient painting "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" (千里江山图). Cinematic, painterly, every frame looks like a living traditional Chinese landscape painting. Rich textures of ink, mineral pigments (石青/石绿), and gold leaf.

**Scene** (60 seconds):

[0-8s] WIDE SHOT. A vast mountain valley, but ALL COLOR HAS DRAINED. Everything is monochrome grey — grey mountains, grey sky, grey flowers, grey waterfall. The world looks like an unfinished ink painting abandoned by its artist. Grey mist rolls through. A 12-year-old girl with short black hair (Melo) stands alone in the center of a shallow stream, barefoot, facing a massive rust-colored serpent coiled before her. Behind her, a small NPC child (6yo, traditional Yao ethnic dress) cowers, her body flickering transparent — she is being erased from existence. Dozens of players flee in the background. Only Melo stands still.

[8-15s] CLOSE-UP on Melo's face. Her eyes close. Her lips part slightly. A single breath. Then — the first NOTE. Not loud. Almost a whisper. A soft golden ripple pulses outward from her lips, like a stone dropped in still water. The ripple expands in a perfect circle.

[15-35s] THE RESTORATION — the most important visual sequence. MEDIUM SHOT, slow 360° camera orbit around Melo. As her song continues (each note a new ripple), COLOR RETURNS to the world in concentric rings spreading from her body:
- First ring (at her feet): Green grass erupts from grey dirt. Small flowers bloom — gold, crimson, azure, violet — popping open one by one in sequence.  
- Second ring (5 meters): The stream regains crystal clarity. Pebbles glow with warm light. Willow branches turn jade-green.
- Third ring (50 meters): Mountain cliffs regain their mineral-blue (石青) color, the pigment visibly seeping back into the rock like ink spreading on wet paper. Vines burst into white blossoms.
- Fourth ring (horizon): The golden waterfall in the distance REIGNITES — grey water flushes gold from top to bottom in one glorious cascade. Rainbows arc back into existence. The sky shifts from ashen to brilliant blue.

Throughout this sequence, every restoration looks like AN ARTIST PAINTING IN REAL-TIME — visible brushstroke textures, colors applied in layers (first outlines, then washes, then detail), exactly mimicking traditional Chinese 青绿山水 painting technique.

[35-45s] CLOSE-UP on the serpent. Its rust-colored scales shift: rust → dark red → brown → pale blue → the blue of clear stream water. Its eyes change from angry vertical slits to round, gentle, reflective. Its body begins to DISSOLVE — not dying, but transforming. The serpent-shape melts into liquid water, flowing gently back into the stream. The water is crystal blue. Where there was a monster, now there is just a peaceful stream flowing over stones.

[45-50s] MEDIUM SHOT. The child behind Melo becomes solid again — her colors return, her Yao-ethnic embroidered dress blooms with vivid flower patterns. She looks up at Melo with wonder. Melo opens her eyes. The world around her is a PAINTING — but brighter, more vivid than before, as if freshly painted. Total silence except for the stream and distant birdsong.

[50-60s] WIDE SHOT pulling back to reveal the entire valley, now restored to full color — jade-green mountains, golden waterfall, rainbow mist, flowers everywhere. Then CUT TO: a distant cliff. Empty. White fog condenses in one spot, solidifying into the shape of a massive white tiger (5 meters long, pure white, gold eyes). It stands on the cliff edge, looking down at the tiny figure of Melo. One slow blink. A slight tilt of the head — a nod of acknowledgment. Then it leaps backward into the forest and vanishes. The last frame: Melo standing alone in the restored world, barefoot in the stream, surrounded by color. Wind moves her hair. A single golden dust mote floats past her face.

**Music/Sound**: Begins in silence. When Melo sings, her voice is a solo — clear, simple, ancient melody (pentatonic, 宫调). As color returns, traditional Chinese instruments layer in one by one: 古琴 (guqin), 笛 (dizi flute), 琵琶 (pipa). By the time the waterfall reignites, full orchestral swell. When the tiger appears, total silence again, then one final 古琴 note.

**Color palette**: Grey/monochrome → 石青 (mineral blue-green), 石绿 (mineral green), 赭石 (ochre), 金 (gold), 朱砂 (vermillion). The final restored world should look EXACTLY like a living version of Wang Ximeng's "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" (千里江山图).

**风格**：中国水墨动画风格，参考《雾山五行》的画面质感与《千里江山图》的色彩体系。每一帧都像一幅活过来的青绿山水画。矿物颜料质感（石青、石绿、赭石、金粉），可见的笔触肌理，电影级构图。

**画面描述**（60秒）：

一片失去了所有颜色的山谷。群山灰白，瀑布灰白，花朵枯萎。世界像一幅被遗弃的水墨底稿。画面中央，一个12岁的短发女孩（麦洛）赤脚站在浅溪中，面前是一条锈红色的巨蛇。身后一个6岁瑶族小女孩正在变透明——她正在被这个世界"擦除"。远处大量玩家在逃跑。只有麦洛站着不动。

她闭上眼睛。嘴唇微启。唱出第一个音符——极轻，几乎是气声。一圈金色的涟漪从她唇间扩散出去。

**核心画面**：镜头绕麦洛360度缓慢旋转。随着她的歌声，颜色以她为圆心向四面八方涌回——脚下青草破土而出，花朵依次绽放（金、赤、青、蓝、紫），溪水恢复清澈，山崖重新渗出石青色（像颜料在宣纸上晕开），远处金色瀑布从灰色中重新点燃，彩虹弯回天空。每一层颜色的恢复都像画师在实时作画——先勾线，再上色，石青石绿层层渲染。

巨蛇的鳞片从锈红变为淡蓝，身体化为清水流回溪中。小女孩的颜色恢复，绣花裙上的花纹重新鲜活。麦洛睁开眼。世界比之前更美——像被重新画了一遍。

最后一个镜头：远处悬崖上，白雾凝聚成一头纯白巨虎（体长五米，金色竖瞳）。它看着麦洛。微微颔首。然后跃入山林，无声消失。

**配乐**：麦洛的声音为主旋律（五声音阶，宫调），随着颜色恢复依次加入古琴、笛、琵琶。白虎出现时全场静默，只有一声古琴收尾。
